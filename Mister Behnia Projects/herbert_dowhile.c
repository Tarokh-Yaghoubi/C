/*	DO-WHILE IN C PROGRAMMING	*/	

/*

	Unlike for and while loops, which test the loop condition at the top of the loop, the do-while loop
	checks its condition at the bottom of the loop. This means that a do-while loop always executes at
	least once. The general form of the do-while loop is :


	do {
		statement;
	} while (condition);

	the braces are not necessary when only one statement is present .
	The do-while loop iterates until the condition becomes false .
