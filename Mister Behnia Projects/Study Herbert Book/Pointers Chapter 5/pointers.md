# Pointers in C programming , Herbert Shieldt Book

```

	The correct understanding and use of pointers is crucial to successful C programming. There are 
	several reasons for this: First, pointers provide the means by which functions can modify their 
	calling arguments. Second, pointers support dynamic allocation. Third, pointers can improve the 
	efficiency of certain routines.

```
- **pointers provide support for dynamic data structures, such as binary trees and linked lists**
- **Pointers are one of the strongest but also one of the most dangerous features in C.**
- **A pointer containing an invalid value can cause your program to crash.**
- **It is easy to use pointers incorrectly, causing bugs that are very difficult to find.**
