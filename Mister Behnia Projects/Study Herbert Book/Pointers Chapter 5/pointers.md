```

	The correct understanding and use of pointers is crucial to successful C programming. There are 
	several reasons for this: First, pointers provide the means by which functions can modify their 
	calling arguments. Second, pointers support dynamic allocation. Third, pointers can improve the 
	efficiency of certain routines.

- **pointers provide support for dynamic data structures, such as binary trees and linked lists**
