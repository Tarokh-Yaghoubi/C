    Digital computers have made possible many scientific, industrial, and commercial advances that
    would have been unattainable otherwise. Our space program would have been impossible without
    real-time, continuous computer monitoring, and many business enterprises function efficiently
    only with the aid of automatic data processing.
    Computers are used in : 

```

- **Scientific Calculations**
- **Commercial and Bussiness Data Processing**
- **Air Traffic Control**
- **Space Guidance**
- **Educational Field**
- **And Many Others ...**

<p color="red">The most striking property of a digital computer is its generality. It can follow a sequence of instructions, called a <i>program</i>, that operates on given data.</p>

    The user can specify and change programs and/or data according to the specific need. As a result of this flexibility, general-
    purpose digital computers can perform a wide variety of information-processing tasks .
    The general-purpose digital computer is the best known example of a digital system , Other examples include :

```
- **Telephone Switching Exchanges**
- **Digital Voltmeters**
- **Frequency Counters**
- **Calculating Machines**
- **Teletype Machines**

```
    Characteristic of a digital system is its manipulation of discrete elements of information. Such discrete elements may be electric impulses, the decimal
    digits, the letters of an alphabet, arithmetic operations, punctuation marks, or any other set of meaningful symbols.

    Early digital computers were used mostly for numerical computations. In this
    case the discrete elements used are the digits. From this application, the term digital computer
    has emerged. A more appropriate name for a digital computer would be a “discrete information
    processing system.”

<h3 color="red">Binaries : </h3>

```
    Discrete elements of information are represented in a digital system by physical quantities
    called signals. Electrical signals such as voltages and currents are the most common. The signals
    in all present-day electronic digital systems have only two discrete values and are said to be
    " binary " .

```
<h3 color="gray">Reliablity :</h3>

```
    The digital-system designer is restricted to the use of binary signals because of the lower reliability of many-valued electronic circuits.
    In other words, a circuit with ten states, using one discrete voltage value for each state, can be designed, but it would possess a very low reliability of operation.
    In contrast, a transistor circuit that is either on or off has two possible signal values and can be constructed to be extremely reliable.

``` 
```

    Because of this physical restriction of components, and because human logic tends to be binary, digital systems that are constrained to take discrete values are further constrained to take binary values. Discrete quantities of information emerge either from the nature of the process or may be purposely quantized from a continuous process. For example, a payroll schedule is an inherently discrete process that contains employee names, social security numbers, weekly salaries, income taxes, etc. An employee’s paycheck is processed using discrete data values such as letters of the alphabet (names), digits (salary), and special symbols such as $. On the other hand, a research scientist may observe a continuous process but record only specific quantities in tabular form . The scientist is thus quantizing his continuous data. Each number in his table is a discrete element of information .
